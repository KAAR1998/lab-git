2. Create a new repository in the GitHub. Name it Iron+ your name. Example: if your name is Alvaro, you will name the repo IronAlvaro.
mkdir IronAlo 
cd IronAlo 
git init 
git remote add origin https://github.com/KAAR1998/lab-git.git

3. Clone that repo to your computer.
mkdir clone 
ls
cd clone 
git clone https://github.com/KAAR1998/lab-git.git

4. Create a file in that folder. Name it about.txt and add a fun fact about yourself. (You can use the command line: touch nameOfTheFile.txt).
cd ../..
ls
cd lab-git
ls
echo "I once ran with the bulls by accident" > about.txt 
open about.txt (to verify it worked)

5. Add the file you just created to the git.
git add /Users/aloaskari/Desktop/Ironhack/Bootcamp/Week_1/Day_1/Afternoon/IronAlo/lab-git/clone/about.txt

6. Commit the changes. 
git commit -m "Added fun fact file" 

7. Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there. 
git push origin master
